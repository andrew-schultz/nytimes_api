# nytimes_api

I've included the NYTimes congressional api in this app. It has all kinds of fun data concerning the US Senate
and House of Representatives. Right now I'm not doing a ton with it inside the app other than allowing a user to enter a states
abbreviation and find out some basic info about that states senators.
